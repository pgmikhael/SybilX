# SybilX

Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Research Base

## Run the model

You can load our pretrained model trained on the NLST dataset, and score a given DICOM serie as follows:

```python
from sybilx import Serie, Sybil

# Load a trained model
model = Sybil.load("sybil_base")

# Get risk scores
serie = Serie([dicom_path_1, dicom_path_2, ...])
scores = model.predict([serie])

# You can also evaluate by providing labels
serie = Serie([dicom_path_1, dicom_path_2, ...], label=1)
results = model.evaluate([serie])

```

Models available are: `sybil_base` and `sybil_ensemble`.

## Replicating results

You can replicate the results from our model using our training script:

```sh
python train.py
```

See our [documentation](docs/readme.md) for a full description of SybilX's training parameters.
